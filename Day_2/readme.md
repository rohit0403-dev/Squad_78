. Camel Case
Example: myVariableName
Usage: Commonly used in JavaScript for naming variables and functions. The first word is in lowercase, and each subsequent word starts with an uppercase letter.
2. Snake Case
Example: my_variable_name
Usage: Often used in Python, but it's not standard in JavaScript. All letters are lowercase, and words are separated by underscores.
3. Pascal Case
Example: MyVariableName
Usage: Used for naming classes in JavaScript. Similar to camel case, but the first letter of each word, including the first word, is uppercase.
4. Kebab Case
Example: my-variable-name
Usage: Typically used in CSS and HTML class names. In JavaScript, it's less common because variable names can't contain hyphens (since hyphens are interpreted as the minus operator).
